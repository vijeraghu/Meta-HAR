# Meta-HAR
This repository implements a meta-learning framework for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) aimed at overcoming the challenge of domain shift. By leveraging meta-learning techniques, this project enhances the adaptability of HAR models, allowing them to generalize better across different datasets, sensor setups, and activity variations.
